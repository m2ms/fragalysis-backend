# Fragalysis backend
Django server for Fragalysis with DRF API and loaders for data. Has components to serve React web-app.

## Documentation: https://fragalysis-backend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html ##

# Dev environment setup
### Background

The stack consists of three services, running as containers: -

- a Postgres database (note: this used to be MySQL)
- a neo4j graph database
- the fraglaysis stack
- a transient data loader container

The stack is formed from code resident in a number of repositories.
Begin by forking repositories you anticipate editing (although you really want
to consider forking all the repositories as this is a relatively low-cost
operation).

The repositories are:

- [xchem/fragalysis](https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis)
- [xchem/fragalysis-frontend](https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis-frontend)
- [xchem/fragalysis-backend](https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis-backend)
- [xchem/fragalysis-stack](https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis-stack)
- [xchem/fragalysis-loader](https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis-loader)

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Git

## Setup

**1.Create project directory, e.g.**


```
mkdir fragalysis
```

**2.Clone repositories inside your project's directory**


You can clone original `xchem` repositories or your forked e.g. `m2ms` and checkout any branch if necessary
```
git clone https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis-backend.git
git clone https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis-frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/xchem/fragalysis-loader.git
git clone https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/dls-fragalysis-stack-openshift.git
```
Note: 
To successful build, it should exist following directories from repository cloning.
Frontend is also important, because DJANGO server will serve this directory!
```$xslt
fragalysis/fragalysis-loader/
fragalysis/fragalysis-frontend/
fragalysis/fragalysis-backend/
fragalysis/dls-fragalysis-stack-openshift/
```

**3.Create some key data directories**


In `fragalysis/` directory run script to create data directory structure
```
mkdir -p data/input/django_data/EXAMPLE
mkdir -p data/neo4j/data
mkdir -p data/neo4j/logs
mkdir -p data/stack/media
mkdir -p data/stack/logs
mkdir -p data/media/compound_sets
mkdir -p data/postgre/data
```
**4.Populating database** 


Copy to `fragalysis/data/input/django_data/EXAMPLE` your PDB data, before you can launch the application.

If not exists file `fragalysis/data/input/django_data/EXAMPLE/TARGET_LIST` create it and content with list of your data, for example:
```
Mpro, NUDT7A,...
```

## Start
Start `Fragalysis stack` (All infrastructure - databases + populating data)

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

`Please wait, it takes a minute until all containers are fully started.`

Test if we are running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

If needed stop containers

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```


Note: The first run will be probably not successful. To fix after first run: 
- Delete the 'mysql_data' folder located in the data folder (Step 3) 
- Delete the migrations by running the commands below in the project directory (Step 1)
```
find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc"  -delete
```
- In the 'fragalysis-frontend' folder rerun the docker compose command another two times 
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Populate database with CompoundSet
The first you need to have upload key.
#### Generate upload key
connect to web_dock service and run following script
```
python manage.py shell
from viewer.models import CSetKeys
new_key = CSetKeys()
new_key.name = 'test'
new_key.save()
print(new_key.uuid)
```

It is important to have key in following format (with `-`)
`f8c4ea0f-6b81-46d0-b85a-3601135756bc` 

#### Upload page
Visit `localhost:8080/viewer/upload_cset` - for computed sets
Visit `localhost:8080/viewer/upload_tset` - for targets

The target name is for example `Mpro`, select `sdf` file and you don't need a `pdb` file. 
Before upload generate upload key.

## Settings

### Development mode in DJANGO

In `settings.py`, the value of `DEBUG` is set to `False` by default. This can be set locally by adding the 
following line to the `web_dock` section of your docker_compose file:

```
    DEBUG_FRAGALYSIS: True
```

or adding the following line to the AWX template: 
```
    stack_debug_fragalysis: True
```
Note that this will also enable logging on the stack, so when coding you can use the logger and then jump on the 
webdock and check the logfile on /logs/ (although this doesn't work from celery yet).

### Sentry error logging

In `settings.py`, this is controlled by setting the value of `SENTRY_DNS`. To enable it, you need to set it to a valid
Sentry DNS entry. For Diamond, this can be set locally by adding the 
following line to the `web_dock` section of your docker_compose file:

```
    SENTRY_DNS: https://27fa0675f555431aa02ca552e93d8cfb@o194333.ingest.sentry.io/1298290
```

or adding the following line to the AWX template: 

```
    stack_backend_sentry_dsn: https://27fa0675f555431aa02ca552e93d8cfb@o194333.ingest.sentry.io/1298290
```
